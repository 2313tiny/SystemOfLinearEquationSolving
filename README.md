# SystemOfLinearEquationSolving

The equation Ax = b gives.

You can find solution for systems of linear equation by
Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel method and Gauss method.

Program generate matrix value.
For this reason put N x N dimensions, and program will generate matrix value
(separate for A matrix into A.txt file , and b matrix into b.txt file)

After calculating you can find solution of systems  in correspond file.
( solution by Jacobi in resJacobi.txt, resGaussSeidel.txt, resGauss.txt)
